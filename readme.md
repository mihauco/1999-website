# 1999 Website

Simple website project made on retro Windows 98 PC, compatipable with Internet Explorer 5 and Netscape Navigator 4.51. Works on modern browsers too (no mobile version - it's was done in the '90s!).

I wrote an article about it on medium.com - [How to create a personal website, but it's 1999](https://medium.com)

Here you can check how it looks - [1999.mihau.co](https://1999.mihau.co)
